Big O
 
# Rule 1:  Worst Case
  *  First you calucate the worst case
  *  In the case of a word search it would be at the very end
# Rule 2:  Remove Constants
  *  in big O you care about how the line moves.  
# Rule 3:  Different terms for inputs
  *  The notion changes based on the number of imputs.   
# Rule 4:  Drop Non Dominants 

*  Dose not matter for small inputs and
*  We need to write scable code to handle the future

O(n!)

//Adding a nested loop for every input.  

1.  Scalable
    *  Speed.  How fast dose run.
    *  How much memory dose it use.  
       +  Memory limited.  

*  Data structures + algorithms = Programs 
What code is best?
*  Readable 
*  Memory - space
*  Speed - time
